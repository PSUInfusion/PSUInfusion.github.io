I’ve been learning Bharatnatyam since the age of four and I continue to pursue this passion as a member of Penn State Natya. I absolutely love to dance and getting involved with the fusion circuit through Infusion last year was such a memorable experience that I can’t wait to delve even further into the dance circuit this year. In my spare time you can find me either singing, traveling, or sleeping.
