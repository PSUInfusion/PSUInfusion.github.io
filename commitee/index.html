                <p style = "font-size: 14px">My name is Shreya Bhatt and I am a freshman planning to major in Neuroscience with double minors in Public Health and Psychology. As yet another dancing fanatic to add to the crew, I have delved into dancing since the age of four and continue my passion for dancing here at Penn State as a member of Penn State Natya. Outside of classical dancing, I also enjoy learning and choreographing all types of dance forms, and look forward to joining the fusion circuit as well with my Infusion family. In my spare time I love to sleep, travel, sing, hang out with friends, and of course, dance. Fun fact: I have an elephant obsession and am afraid of the dark.</p>
