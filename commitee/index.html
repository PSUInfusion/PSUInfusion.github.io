                <p style="font-size: 14px">Hey guys! My name is Shivam and I am a sophomore majoring in biology (typical). I’m from Mechanicsburg, PA, which is really close to Harrisburg. This is my first year as liaison and I am super excited for Infusion weekend 2015! Some random facts about me: if you want my love, buy be orange chicken from Panda express with two veggie spring rolls. Suits is my favorite show on Earth (call me Harvey), I love dancing/ being obnoxious, my favorite place on Earth is Avalon, New Jersey, and I love traveling. Anyway, can’t wait to experience the best weekend of the semester with all of you!</p>

I believe there really is no limit to the possibilities in the world today. I like to tackle every challenge with more challenges. If something needs to be done, why not put a time limit on there to make myself work harder? Music is something I cannot resist, if someone hands me a guitar or takes me to a piano, I can't help but play it! My favorite hobby by far is driving! I love technology so thats probably why I'm a computer science major! Although I am a freshman, I have been determined to do computer science from a very young age! My goal with infusion is to learn a lot and give a lot to the technology side! </p>
