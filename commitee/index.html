I always find a way to help others, for me there is no greater joy than putting a smile on someone’s face. To be honest, that is exactly what Infusion has done for me. It gave me a family who always put a smile on my face. This will be my second year on Infusion, and I have had no greater experience here in college then I have had with Infusion.

                <p style = "font-size: 14px">My name is Shreya Bhatt and I am a junior majoring in Neurobiology and double minoring in Psychology and Business. I’ve been learning Bharatnatyam since the age of four and I continue to pursue this passion as a member of Penn State Natya. I absolutely love to dance and getting involved with the fusion circuit through Infusion these past two years has been such a memorable experience that I can’t wait to delve even further into the dance circuit this year. In my spare time, I enjoy photography, traveling, and singing. Fun Fact: I’ve been playing the piano for 14 years!</p>
