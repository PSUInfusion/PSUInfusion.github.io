                <p style="font-size: 14px;">I joined infusion because I wanted to get involved with a organization that related to my love for dance. I love how teams from different parts of the nation compete to songs that I listen to. Also, it's awesome to meet people who share the same passion and culture as you. As a freshman, I couldn't be happier!</p>
